## instanced-rendering

implements webgl instanced rendering on a relatively higher poly model
supports:

* basic .obj loading
* some arbitrary procedural texturing (checkerboard, strips, polka dots)
* debugging model normals
* tools to change animation properties and some rendering properties (falloff, instance count)

### NOTE

there is meant to be an obj asset to load with this. the one i used doesn't belong to me, and i don't
think i have the rights to redistribute it + haven't replaced it with something in the public domain (yet).

as a result, this _won't_ work as written without a valid .obj asset, and even then your experience may vary.
